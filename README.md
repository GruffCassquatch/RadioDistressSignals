# Radio Distress Signals

FOR GAME VERSION 2.0+ **LIVING LARGE**   
This mod allows all of the radio distress messages from other lifepods to play after you repair the radio. This reflects the fact that all of these messages were broadcast while the player was unconscious and allows you to investigate them in any order your prefer.
